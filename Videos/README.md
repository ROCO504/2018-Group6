This folder contains the videos of the project. 

Various Project Part Designs is a compilation video of the CAD that went into developing the Prosthetic Thumb. Intitial parts show a more complete design history while later parts had this turned off so may jump from different versions. 

Ball Joint Impact and Additional Joint Impact demonstrate how the design of variable compliance in the 3D parts when combined with soft tendon materials allows the thumb to return to its original position upon an impact. The videos show how this can work even when the motors are not connected if the ball socket has been left in a closed position.
